The CUE4CHNG project uses an exploratory sequential mixed methods design, 
which begins with exploratory activities and builds to more systematic 
testing of research questions concerning how particular user preferences 
influence student participation. The project engages in data mining 
of syllabi, course content, public spaces, and instructor materials to 
aggregate information about curricula presented in different representational 
forms, such as equations, images, narratives, simulations, and videos. 
From these data, it is anticipated that qualitatively and quantitatively 
distinct profiles of course representations will be generated. The 
project tracks longitudinal persistence of students in STEM, in 
relationship to course structure and individual learner preferences. 
Understanding the intersection between learner preferences and engineering 
curricula has the potential to improve engineering education and broaden 
participation in the field of engineering.
